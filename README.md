# Supercake Coding Challenge by STANISLAV NIKOLAIEVSKYI

## Solution

* I did not use any technologies outside the provided `package.json`.

* Icons were converted into an icon font, since it is lighter than SVG

* Animations rely mostly on CSS with minimal JavaScript for better performance

* Data fetching is done with the standard fetch API

* The project is structured hierarchically into components → modules → widgets, making future development and scaling easier

* Also, I added display of information about customers

* Since I didn't have access to Figma DevTools, I tried to copy the colors and styles as close to the original as possible.

* Added .env file with `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000`

## Getting Started

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
